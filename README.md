# amp-dialer
Forked from https://github.com/blackc2004/fusionpbx-clicktocall.

Customized with AMP Systems, LLC logo for internal use and added some error checking for highlighted string.

This is a .NET app for quick dialing on FusionPBX.

Build the project in Visual Studio.

Double click to run. It will then launch a system tray application. 

Right-click on the application in the system tray and click **Settings**.
Populate the domain (e.g.`pbx.fusionpbx.com` with no HTTP/HTTPS), API key, and extension.

Highlight a phone number in any application. Press **CRTL-SHIFT-C**.

You should see a popup in the lower right corner saying *“Calling…”* with the phone number.
Your extension will ring.
Pick up the phone and it will start dialing out.
